### Running the Development Server over HTTPS
  
This project uses `https-localhost` to serve content securely during development. To start the development server with HTTPS enabled, use the `dev:https` script:
```bash
npm run dev:https
```
After starting the server, open [https://localhost](https://localhost) in your browser to view the app. `https-localhost` ensures the local development certificate is trusted by your browser, facilitating the testing of PWA features that require HTTPS, such as service workers and secure context features.

## Features

- **React** for building user interfaces with a component-based architecture.
- **TypeScript** for static type definitions, enhancing development experience and code quality.
- **Vite** for ultra-fast development and bundling, leveraging modern web technologies.
- **PWA** setup for offline support, background sync, and installability, with a secure HTTPS development environment provided by https-localhost.

## Building for Production

To build the app for production, run the following command:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will generate a dist directory with your compiled assets, ready to be deployed.

## Deployment

Refer to the [Vite Deployment Guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy) for specific instructions on deploying your application to popular hosting providers.
